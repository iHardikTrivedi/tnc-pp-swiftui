I am stuck in SwiftUI code and need helps of experts.
I want following functionality in SwiftUI:

I tried and create this project and the working functionality is fine like:
-> highlight color
-> click action for the highlighted part

But it still doesn't look the way I want. Check below output:

Please let me know if anyone made this kind of view properly.
This part is easily made with UIKit, but it's hard for SwiftUI views.
